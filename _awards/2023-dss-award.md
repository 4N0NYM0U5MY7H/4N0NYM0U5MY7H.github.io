I was honored to receive the Drucilla Shepard Smith Award from the Oregon State University Faculty Senate Student Recognition and Awards Committee. This prestigious award is presented annually to students who have maintained a 4.0 grade point average during their time at OSU. It is one of the universityâ€™s highest honors, recognizing sustained academic excellence across the entire student body.
