I was awarded a research grant from the Student Engagement in Research, Scholarship, and Creative Activity (SERSCA) program at California State University, Stanislaus. This funding will support my ongoing research in the Forbes Lab at the University of Iowa, where I am investigating the ecology of Cynipidae (gall wasps) and their associated parasitoid communities. The grant will assist with covering costs related to fieldwork, specimen collection, and laboratory analysis, allowing me to contribute to the broader understanding of insect-plant interactions and coevolution.
