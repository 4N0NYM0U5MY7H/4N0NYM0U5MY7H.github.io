I was awarded a travel grant from the Student Engagement in Research, Scholarship, and Creative Activity (SERSCA) program at California State University, Stanislaus. This funding will support my participation in the 2024 Association of Pacific Coast Geographers (APCG) Annual Conference in Arcata, CA, where I will present on climate resiliency and sustainability in the northern San Joaquin Valley. The grant will cover travel expenses, providing an opportunity to engage with fellow researchers and professionals in the fields of geography and environmental science.
