# Curriculum Vitae
I am an undergraduate researcher specializing in Geography and Environmental Resources with a minor in Computer Science. My interdisciplinary research focus spans GIS, remote sensing, fire ecology, and ecocultural restoration. I aim to contribute to landscape-level conservation and open science initiatives through data-driven, community-engaged research.

## Education
**B.S. Geography and Environmental Resources**, Minor: Computer Science — California State University, Stanislaus (Expected 2026)

<hr />

## Research experience
### Research Assistant — Human-Environment eXploration (HEX) Lab, Stanislaus State
(January 2025 – Present)
* Built custom mobile workflows using ArcGIS Field Maps for urban tree inventory and environmental assessment.
* Collected biometric and spatial data (e.g., DBH, canopy spread, species) to support analysis of forest ecosystem services.
* Designed a participatory research framework integrating citizen science and open-source mapping tools for community engagement.

### Field Research Assistant — Forbes Lab, University of Iowa
(August 2023 – Present)
* Conducted fieldwork on Cynipidae (gall wasps), documenting plant-insect interactions, collecting galls, and studying parasitic insect communities.
* Reared insect specimens to monitor life cycles and prepare samples for DNA sequencing and parasitic ecology research.

<hr />

## Work experience
### GIS Intern — Stanislaus State
(October 2024 – Present)
* Developed and maintained geodatabases for campus planning projects using ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Online.
* Collected high-accuracy GNSS data with trimble Geo7x for campus vegetation and infrastructure mapping.
* Automated spatial workflows using Python, improving processing efficiency and reproducibility.

### Climate Action Fellow — Stanislaus State College Corps
(August 2024 – May 2025)
* Participated in ecological restoration projects across California, including native plantings, invasive species removal, and urban green space initiatives.
