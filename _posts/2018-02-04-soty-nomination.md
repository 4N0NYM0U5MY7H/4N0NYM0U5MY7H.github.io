Education has been a constant, yet complex companion in my life. Throughout my journey, I have felt the pull of a deep passion for learning, while simultaneously facing the barriers that have kept me from fully pursuing a traditional educational path. Growing up in poverty, like many of my peers, I found solace and opportunity in places like the public library, where I could explore new ideas and interests outside of formal schooling. However, the instability of my home life meant that I moved frequently, ultimately leading to my inability to graduate high school. It was a chance conversation with a friend that introduced me to the California High School Proficiency Exam, which I passed, marking a significant, albeit unconventional, milestone in my education. This would be my experience with school for many years.

My aspirations to further my education took shape when I initially sought to join the US Army Corps of Engineers and eventually become a civil engineer. Unfortunately, a pre-existing medical condition thwarted these plans, forcing me to enter the workforce sooner than expected. At the time, I saw work as my only viable option, driven by the need to support myself and my family.

Years later, with a family to care for, I faced unexpected hardships in finding stable employment. Despite a solid work history and experience in management, I encountered an unforeseen challenge: the demand for both education and experience in every job I applied for. Without the benefit of a traditional degree or college experience, I quickly realized how my lack of formal education worked against me. While I was more than willing to work entry-level jobs, they were simply not enough to support my family. As my unemployment benefits ran out, I found myself relying on other forms of assistance. Yet, it was during this challenging time that I discovered an unexpected opportunity to pursue higher education.

Through the generosity of the Stanislaus Community Services Agency, I was able to attend Modesto Junior College through the Accelerated Careers Training program. Without their support, this opportunity might have remained out of reach. This unexpected chance to pursue college has dramatically shifted my perception of education. In the past, I had seen schooling as merely a way to gain work experience, a cost to be paid for the sake of a job. Yet now, with the weight of tuition lifted from my shoulders, I see higher education in a new light. This shift in perspective is a result of the profound experience of learning again, and realizing that education can be so much more than just a means to an end.

There are, of course, significant challenges that still lie ahead. One of the most immediate of these is transportation. Living without a vehicle means relying solely on public transportation, which, while valuable, has its limitations. My long commute, including the hours spent waiting for buses and riding them between Turlock and Modesto, adds an additional 15 hours to my week. During the Fall 2017 semester, when I had late classes, I often had to rely on classmates and coworkers for rides home, sometimes uncertain of how I would get back. This experience, though stressful, has taught me an invaluable lesson: it’s okay to ask for help. I’ve had to confront my own tendency to do everything alone and come to terms with the fact that support from others is not just helpful, but necessary at times.

Another ongoing challenge is finding balance between school, work, and family. The demands of two jobs, schoolwork, and personal projects leave little room for downtime, and my time with my wife and children is often reduced to fleeting moments. I have learned to value this time more than ever, setting aside Sunday afternoons as sacred time for family. However, the weight of chronic pain from a medical condition compounds the difficulty of managing these competing demands. There are times when exhaustion and discomfort blur the lines between my roles as a student, a worker, and a father. But, these challenges have also brought a sense of maturity to my relationships, and I’ve come to appreciate the preciousness of our time together.

The limited time I have has led me to think creatively about how to engage with my education and community. I volunteered as a tutor for computer science students during the Fall 2017 semester, offering my time to help others while furthering my own understanding of concepts in courses like Computer Electronics and Introduction to Programming. The experience was incredibly rewarding, not only for the satisfaction of helping others, but for the friendships I developed along the way. It has reminded me that education is not just an individual pursuit, but a communal one.

My involvement in work study at the college has also provided both financial support and personal growth. By working alongside students and faculty, I have gained valuable professional references and made connections that will help me in the future. On a personal level, I’ve had the opportunity to meet new people, forming friendships that enrich my life.

Despite my impatience with traditional learning paces, I continue to push myself beyond my enrolled courses. I have taken numerous free online courses to expand my knowledge in computer science and electrical engineering, alongside my regular studies. This commitment to learning, in whatever form it takes, has helped me maintain a sense of momentum and motivation in my education.

Reflecting on the past year, I can’t help but marvel at how far I’ve come. With the support of the CSA and my own determination, I have completed 20 units while maintaining a 3.68 GPA. I’m on track to complete my certificate of achievement by the Spring 2018 semester and have already planned additional courses toward a future Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. While my journey is far from over, the progress I’ve made so far has given me a sense of pride and accomplishment that I did not anticipate.

Looking ahead, I hope to transition from my current role in office management to a career in the technology sector, where I can apply the knowledge and experience I’ve gained. The combination of continued education and work experience will, I believe, open up new opportunities for both my career and my family’s future. With the network of support I’ve built through programs like CalWORKs, I am confident that I will achieve these goals and continue to build on the foundation of education I’ve worked so hard to create.
