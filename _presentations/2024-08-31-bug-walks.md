Concetta (CeCe) Hurst-Hart, president of the Northern San Joaquin Valley chapter of the California Native Plant Society, invited me to host a three-part workshop series that delved into the complex relationship between native plants and invertebrates. This guided hike series aimed to educate participants on how native plants support diverse invertebrate populations and contribute to the overall health of the ecosystem. Each session focused on a different aspect of this interaction, from observing arthropod activity to discussing the negative effects of insecticides and the broader importance of native plants.

## Day 1 (August 3, 2024)
The first session of the workshop series centered on observing the evidence of arthropod activity in the environment. Participants examined signs of feeding, various forms of leaf and host plant damage, and a range of gall formations on different host plants along the Trans-California Pathway.

## Day 2 (August 17, 2024)
In the second session, we discussed the unintended consequences of insecticides on native invertebrate populations. We explored how pesticides, often intended to target specific "pests," frequently fail to deter them, while effectively eliminating their natural predators. During our walk, we observed numerous arthropods that showed signs of recent pesticide exposure, particularly on the south side of Naraghi Hall, around Willow Lake, near the Greenhouse, and along the western edge of the Trans-California Pathway.

## Day 3 (August 31, 2024)
The final session of the series condluded with a guided tour of the Trans-California Pathway. Here, participants gained deeper insights into the essential role that native plants play in supporting a diverse range of invertebrates and maintaining ecosystem health. Throughout the walk, we encouraged participants to search for signs of insects and other arthropods, and had the opportunity to handle various species, including *Stagmomantis limbata*, *Boisea rubrolineata*, and *Murganita histrionica*.
