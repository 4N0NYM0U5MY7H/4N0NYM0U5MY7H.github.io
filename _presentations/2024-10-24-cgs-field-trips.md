## Poster
The San Joaquin Valley, renowned for its agricultural output and its role as a major freeway corridor connecting Southern and Northern California, faces increasing environmental pressure due to climate change. This project aims to explore sustainable land management practices in the region. With the support of College Corps, the California Geographical Society (CGS) is organizing field trips as part of its annual conference, set for April 2025, to examine climate resiliency and sustainability in the northern San Joaquin Valley. These trips will highlight the critical importance of sustainable land management for both environmental and human health.
