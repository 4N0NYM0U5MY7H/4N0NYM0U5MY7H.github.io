I presented on behalf of the HEX Lab (formerly HEIR Lab) at the Stanislaus State Sustainability Showcase. In this lightning talk, I highlighted the ongoing progress and past contributions of former students to the land classification project. I focused on the ecosystem benefits and services provided by the university's urban forest, emphasizing its importance in supporting environmental health. Additionally, I discussed the potential for future research and the crucial role of community engagement in advancing the project.

A recording of the presentation is available on YouTube: [Stan State Sustainability Showcase March 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XikKzob_FUk).
