Concetta (CeCe) Hurst-Hart, president of the Northern San Joaquin Valley chapter of the California Native Plant Society, invited me to host a three-part workshop series exploring the intricate relationship between native plants and invertebrates. This first walk focused on analyzing evidence of arthropod activity. We looked at evidence of feeding, talked about various forms of leaf and host plant damage, and examined many gall forms on different host plants on the Trans-California Pathway.

Observational photographs that I took during this event were shared on iNaturalist and Instagram.
