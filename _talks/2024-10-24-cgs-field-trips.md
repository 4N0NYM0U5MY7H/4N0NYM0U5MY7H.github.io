## Poster
The San Joaquin Valley is well known for its significant agricultural production and freeway corridor between southern and northern California. With increasing environmental stresses due to climate change, this project explores examples of sustainable land management in the region. Through support from College Corps, the California Geographical Society (CGS) is exploring climate resiliency and sustainability in the northern San Joaquin Valley with several field trips as part of its annual conference, planned for April 2025. These field trips focus on the importance of sustainable land management for both environmental and human health.
