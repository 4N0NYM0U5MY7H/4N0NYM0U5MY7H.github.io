I presented on behalf of the HEIR Lab at the Sustainability Showcase. This lightning talk highlighted the current progress and past work of previous students on the land classification project. I focused on the ecosystem benefits and services provided by the university's urban forest. I also discussed the potential for future research and the importance of community engagement in the project.
